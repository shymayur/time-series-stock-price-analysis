Its the time series analysis of stock price data.

Time series analysis means analyzing and finding patterns in a time series dataset.
A time-series dataset is a sequence of data collected over an interval of time.
Stock price data, monthly sales data, daily rainfall data, hourly website traffic data are some examples of time-series data that you will get to solve business problems as a data scientist.

# Time Series Analysis
Whenever you are analyzing a dataset recorded over a time interval, you are doing Time Series Analysis. 
The time interval of a time series data can be weekly, monthly, daily, or even hourly time intervals, but the process of analyzing your data will remain the same in most of the problems.
I've used the plotly library in Python here as it is easy to analyze data with plotly because of less code and interactive results.
I will recommend using a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory for Time series analysis instead of using a code editor or an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm.
